# 🎉 Sample Festival Feedback Issues

These are sample feedback items to test the triage system. Create these as GitHub issues to see the automated triage in action!

## Sample Issue 1: Sound System Problem (URGENT)

**Title:** Sound system completely failed during main stage performance

**Category:** Venue & Facilities

**Sentiment:** Very Negative

**Feedback:**
The sound system at the main stage cut out completely during the headliner's performance at 8:30 PM. This lasted for about 15 minutes and caused significant frustration among the crowd of approximately 500 attendees. People started leaving, and it really impacted the overall festival experience. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed before the next event.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Invest in backup sound equipment
- Have a technician on standby during all performances
- Test all equipment thoroughly before each major performance
- Consider renting professional-grade equipment for future events

## Sample Issue 2: Food Truck Variety (FEATURE REQUEST)

**Title:** More vegetarian and vegan food options needed

**Category:** Food & Beverages

**Sentiment:** Positive

**Feedback:**
Overall had a great time at the festival! The music was fantastic and the venue was beautiful. However, I noticed there were limited options for vegetarians and vegans. Out of 8 food trucks, only 1 had clear vegan options. As someone who's plant-based, I found myself waiting in long lines for the one truck that could accommodate my dietary needs.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Require all food vendors to have at least 2 vegetarian/vegan options
- Add 2-3 dedicated plant-based food trucks
- Clearly label all menu items with dietary information (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)
- Consider creating a food vendor map with dietary filters

## Sample Issue 3: Parking and Accessibility (POSITIVE FEEDBACK)

**Title:** Excellent accessibility accommodations and parking

**Category:** Venue & Facilities

**Sentiment:** Very Positive

**Feedback:**
I wanted to take a moment to commend the festival organizers for the outstanding accessibility features! The accessible parking was well-marked and close to the entrance. The wheelchair-accessible pathways throughout the venue were wide and well-maintained. The viewing platform for those with mobility issues was perfect and gave a great view of the stage.

As someone who uses a wheelchair, I often struggle at outdoor events, but this festival made me feel completely included. The staff were also incredibly helpful and attentive. Thank you for making this such a positive experience!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Maybe add one more accessible restroom facility near the food area
- Consider accessible seating near the smaller stages as well
- Everything else was perfect!
